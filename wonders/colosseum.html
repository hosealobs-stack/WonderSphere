      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        In the heart of Rome stands the Colosseum, an amphitheater that epitomizes the grandeur of the Roman Empire. Completed in 80 CE under Emperor Titus, 
        it could hold between 50,000–80,000 spectators. The Colosseum hosted gladiatorial combats, mock naval battles, wild animal hunts, and public spectacles.

      <p>
        Beneath the arena was the hypogeum, a complex network of tunnels and chambers where gladiators and animals awaited their turn. The Colosseum’s innovative 
        design  including retractable awnings to shade spectators  influenced stadium architecture for centuries. Though damaged by earthquakes and stone robbers, 
        it remains a powerful symbol of Rome’s history.

        Although the Colosseum has been partially damaged by earthquakes and stone robbers over the centuries, it is still an iconic testament to Roman history, visited 
        by thousands of tourists every year. Thus, it stands to reason that it would make the list of today’s seven wonders of the world.

        The Colosseum in Rome was built in the second half of the first century, thanks to the ruling Flavian dynasty. The reason behind such a mighty investment was, of course, politics, or rather the total political chaos that ensued in Rome after the overthrow of Nero in the year 68.
Just imagine a vast city with a powerful and quite eccentric emperor sitting on the throne. While Nero did make Rome powerful and prosperous, his approach to power and his person offended the Roman nobility. Nero’s increasingly despotic rule eventually led to a rebellion of legions in many provinces. Some contenders for the throne declared themselves new emperors, while others were chosen by dissatisfied residents of Rome.
Ultimately, betrayed by everyone, even by his Praetorian Guard, Nero committed suicide. This moment was described by the famous Roman historian:

After Nero’s death, chaos reigned in Rome, and power changed hands frequently. Eventually, the most powerful contender for power turned out to be the commander of the legions stationed in Egypt, Judea, and Syria, Vespasian. After suppressing the Jewish rebellion in Jerusalem, he returned to the Eternal City and began the rule of the Flavian dynasty.

However, as mentioned earlier, Rome was in chaos, and the new emperor had to go to great lengths to stay in power while ensuring the strength of the city and the entire empire by radically raising taxes. To quell the dissatisfaction of the residents of the Eternal City, Vespasian decided to distance himself from the previous emperor. In place of Nero’s golden palaces, he built a massive arena, the Colosseum, where ordinary residents of Rome could join the wealthiest nobility in watching spectacles prepared for them. This was in line with the ancient Roman doctrine: “The citizen needs games and bread.”
Now that you know the origin and purpose of the Colosseum, let’s delve into what transpired in the immense arena to delight tens of thousands of spectators.

In the Colosseum’s arena in Rome, gladiator battles took place, considered one of the most popular forms of entertainment in ancient times. Gladiators were often slaves, captured in newly conquered lands, but among them were also criminals and even free individuals who signed multi-year contracts. Interestingly, women also appeared among the gladiators, although it was not common.
In Rome, the first gladiator contests occurred in 105 BCE and almost immediately became the favourite pastime of the residents of the Eternal City. Gladiator schools began to emerge like mushrooms, and wealthy Romans bought their warriors, paying fortunes for their training.
Since the construction of the Colosseum, Rome became the main centre for gladiator fights and the headquarters of private enterprises specializing in the training of warriors, whose sole purpose was to hone both body and spirit through training and exercises.
Gathered in one place, the well-trained warriors commanded respect and instilled fear of rebellion. Any signs of disobedience were punished with death. Gladiators trained daily with wooden weapons and only received access to their real combat counterparts just before entering the arena. The fighting arena was usually surrounded by detachments of soldiers who could pacify any gladiator rebellion.
Contrary to popular belief, gladiator fights very rarely ended in death. Their training was so expensive and lengthy that most clashes concluded with the shedding of the first blood.
