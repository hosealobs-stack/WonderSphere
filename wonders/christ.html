      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Overlooking Rio de Janeiro from Mount Corcovado, the Christ the Redeemer statue is one of the most recognizable monuments in the world. Built between 1922 and 1931, 
        this 30-meter-tall Art Deco masterpiece was the result of a collaboration between Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, French sculptor Paul Landowski, Romanian 
        artist Gheorghe Leonida (who carved the face), and structural engineer Albert Caquot.

      <p>
        Symbolizing peace and faith, the statue with outstretched arms has become a cultural and spiritual icon, not only of Brazil but of Christianity worldwide. Constructed of 
        reinforced concrete and covered in soapstone tiles, the monument has withstood decades of harsh weather and frequent lightning strikes. The summit offers breathtaking views 
        of Rio’s beaches, forests, and favelas, making it both a pilgrimage site and a tourist attraction.
