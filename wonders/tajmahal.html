      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
   The Taj Mahal in Agra, India, is one of the most beautiful monuments ever built — a symbol of love, loss, 
   and artistry. Commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, it was built as a mausoleum for his beloved 
   wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died in childbirth.

      <p>
        Constructed over 22 years with 20,000 workers, the Taj Mahal blends Persian, Islamic, and Indian architecture. 
        Its white marble dome, intricate inlay of semi-precious stones, symmetrical gardens, and reflecting pools create a 
        breathtaking vision of harmony. Surrounding the main mausoleum are a mosque, guest house, and formal gardens.
        The Taj Mahal is not just an architectural marvel but also a cultural emblem of India, drawing millions of visitors every 
        year who come to witness its changing colors from dawn to dusk.

      <p>
        The inspiration for the Taj Mahal was a verse by Bibadal Khan, the imperial goldsmith and poet. 
        The vision behind the construction was to make an earthly replica of Mumtaz Mahal’s celestial abode in paradise. 
        The plans for the complex have been attributed to various architects of the period, though the chief architect was 
        probably Ustad Aḥmad Lahawrī, an Indian of Persian descent. The five principal elements of the complex—main gateway, 
        garden, mosque, jawāb (literally “answer”; a building mirroring the mosque), and mausoleum (including its four minarets)—were 
        conceived and designed as a unified entity according to the tenets of Mughal building practice, which allowed no subsequent 
        addition or alteration. Building commenced about 1632. More than 20,000 workers were employed from India, Persia, the Ottoman 
        Empire, and Europe to complete the mausoleum itself by about 1638–39; the adjunct buildings were finished by 1643, and decoration
         work continued until at least 1647. In total, construction of the 42-acre (17-hectare) complex spanned 22 years.
