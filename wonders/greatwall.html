      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        The Great Wall of China is a network of fortifications built to defend
        Chinese states from invasions. Construction began in the 7th century BCE
        and continued through the Ming dynasty (14th–17th centuries).

        The Great Wall of China is one of the most iconic human-made structures in history, stretching across
        northern China like a colossal dragon of stone and earth. It was not built all at once — instead, it is 
        a series of walls, fortresses, beacon towers, and passes constructed and rebuilt by various dynasties over 
        more than 2,000 years. The earliest walls date to the 7th century BCE, but the most famous and best-preserved 
        sections were built under the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). The wall’s main purpose was military defense — guarding 
        against nomadic invasions, particularly from the Mongols. But it also served to regulate trade and immigration 
        along the Silk Road, and to assert imperial power. With garrisons, watchtowers, and signal stations, soldiers used 
        smoke by day and fire by night to send messages rapidly across great distances.
        Beyond its strategic role, the wall has become a cultural symbol of China’s unity, strength, and perseverance. Today, 
        visitors can explore restored sections near Beijing like Badaling and Mutianyu, or trek the wild, untouched portions
        that snake across rugged mountains and deserts.

        The Great Wall is more than just a wall; it is a sophisticated defense system. Besides blocking invaders with the wall 
        itself, the beacon towers on the Great Wall also played a crucial role. Upon spotting enemy forces, soldiers would light 
        beacons, sending plumes of thick smoke into the sky. This was an extremely fast military warning method before the advent 
        of the telegraph. The location of the Great Wall usually relied on natural barriers, avoiding flat terrain as much as 
        possible to increase the difficulty for nomadic cavalry to reach and cross. However, the Great Wall itself was like a highway, 
        capable of transporting troops. The watchtowers distributed along the Great Wall could be used by soldiers for residence and 
        storage of weapons and provisions, providing convenience for their own forces. Key passes, such as Shanhaiguan Pass and 
        Jiayuguan Pass, served as crucial garrison points, allowing for both offensive maneuvers and solid defense.

      <h2>The Great Wall of China is the longest man-made structure in the world</h2>
      Because the Great Wall was discontinuous, Mongol invaders led by Genghis Khan (“universal ruler”) had no problem going around the wall and they subsequently conquered most of northern China between A.D. 1211 and 1223. They ruled all of China until 1368 when the Ming defeated the Mongols.
      The dynasties after the Qin which seriously added to and rebuilt the Great Wall were the Han (206 B.C.-A.D. 220), Sui (A.D. 581-618), Jin (115-1234) and, most famously, the Ming (1368-1644). What survives today are the stone and brick walls predominately from the Ming dynasty.
      It is common to hear that the mortar used to bind the stones was made from human bones or that men are buried within the Great Wall to make it stronger. However, the mortar was actually made from rice flour—and no bones, human or otherwise, have ever been found in any of the Great Wall’s walls .

      <h2>The Great Wall of China supposedly follows the tracks of a helpful dragon</h2>
      According to legend, a helpful dragon traced out the course of the Great Wall for the workforce. The builders subsequently followed the tracks of the dragon.
      A popular legend about the Great Wall is the story of Meng Jiang Nu, a wife of a farmer who was forced to work on the wall during the Qin Dynasty. When she heard her husband had died while working the wall, she wept until the wall collapsed, revealing his bones so she could bury them.
      Uranus, or Tianwang, who was the personification of Heaven, is often portrayed on the reliefs found at strategic points and passes on the Great Wall.
      Historian Arthur Walden established that the popular concept of one Great Wall, and even the name itself, entered Chinese consciousness not directly from the Chinese tradition, but rather through European sources who idealized the Wall. In fact, the Wall rarely appeared in Chinese art before the twentieth century.
      Novelist Franz Kafka (1883-1924) praised the Great Wall as a great feat of human engineering. He even wrote a short story titled “The Great Wall of China” about an educated man who reflects on his life’s work overseeing the building of small portions of the Wall.
