      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Nestled high in the Andes Mountains at 2,430 meters, Machu Picchu is an Inca citadel often called the “Lost City of the Incas.” 
        Believed to have been built in the 15th century during the reign of Pachacuti, Machu Picchu served as a royal estate, religious 
        sanctuary, or possibly both. The site is a marvel of Incan engineering: agricultural terraces carved into the mountainside, precise 
        stone masonry that fits without mortar, and water channels that still function today. Spanish conquerors never found Machu Picchu, 
        sparing it from destruction. Rediscovered by American historian Hiram Bingham in 1911, it has since become Peru’s most famous tourist 
        attraction and a symbol of Andean heritage.

        Embedded within a dramatic landscape at the meeting point between the Peruvian Andes and the Amazon Basin, the Historic Sanctuary of 
        Machu Picchu is among the greatest artistic, architectural and land use achievements anywhere and the most significant tangible legacy 
        of the Inca civilization. Recognized for outstanding cultural and natural values, the mixed World Heritage property covers 32,592 hectares 
        of mountain slopes, peaks and valleys surrounding its heart, the spectacular archaeological monument of “La Ciudadela” (the Citadel) at more
         than 2,400 meters above sea level. Built in the fifteenth century Machu Picchu was abandoned when the Inca Empire was conquered by the Spaniards 
         in the sixteenth century. It was not until 1911 that the archaeological complex was made known to the outside world. The approximately 200 structures 
         making up this outstanding religious, ceremonial, astronomical and agricultural centre are set on a steep ridge, crisscrossed by stone terraces. 
         Following a rigorous plan the city is divided into a lower and upper part, separating the farming from residential areas, with a large square between 
         the two. To this day, many of Machu Picchu’s mysteries remain unresolved, including the exact role it may have played in the Incas’ sophisticated 
         understanding of astronomy and domestication of wild plant species.

        Visiting the remains of Machu Picchu in Peru is a pilgrimage that many feel drawn to experience. Originally built as an estate for an Incan Emperor, 
        the site is believed to have been constructed in the mid-14th century. It is located in the Cusco Region of the Urubamba Province. It was abandoned 
        roughly a century later during the time of the Spanish Conquest. The result was a city left to deteriorate slowly. Interestingly, while locals knew 
        the whereabouts and significance of this site, the outside world (including the Spanish during their conquest) was largely left in the dark about the 
        existence of Machu Picchu until 1911, when American historian, Hiram Bingham, brought it to the limelight. Bingham’s revelation catalyzed renovations 
        on the site to begin. The site was built with stone walls that were dried and polished. A handful of the remaining restored structures are considered 
        highly significant and worthy of individual attention. Here’s a look at a few points of interest to those visiting the Incan Citadel.

        The massive yet refined architecture of Machu Picchu blends exceptionally well with the stunning natural environment, with which it is intricately linked. 
        Numerous subsidiary centres, an extensive road and trail system, irrigation canals and agricultural terraces bear witness to longstanding, often on-going 
        human use. The rugged topography making some areas difficult to access has resulted in a mosaic of used areas and diverse natural habitats. The Eastern 
        slopes of the tropical Andes with its enormous gradient from high altitude “Puna” grasslands and Polylepis thickets to montane cloud forests all the way 
        down towards the tropical lowland forests are known to harbour a rich biodiversity and high endemism of global significance. Despite its small size the 
        property contributes to conserving a very rich habitat and species diversity with remarkable endemic and relict flora and fauna.

        <h3>Criterion (i): </h3>
        The Inca City of the Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu is the articulating centre of its surroundings, a masterpiece of art, urbanism, architecture and 
        engineering of the Inca Civilization. The working of the mountain, at the foot of the Huaya Picchu, is the exceptional result of integration with its 
        environment, the result from a gigantic effort as if it were an extension of nature.
        
        <h3>Criterion (iii):</h3>
        The Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu is a unique testimony of the Inca Civilization and shows a well-planned distribution of functions within space, 
        territory control, and social, productive, religious and administrative organization.
        
        <h3>Criterion (vii): </h3>
        The historic monuments and features in the Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu are embedded within a dramatic mountain landscape of exceptional scenic and
        geomorphological beauty thereby providing an outstanding example of a longstanding harmonious and aesthetically stunning relationship between human culture 
        and nature.
        
        <h3>Criterion (ix): </h3>
        Covering part of the transition between the High Andes and the Amazon Basin the Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu shelters a remarkably diverse array of 
        microclimates, habitats and species of flora and fauna with a high degree of endemism. The property is part of a larger area unanimously considered of global 
        significance for biodiversity conservation.
