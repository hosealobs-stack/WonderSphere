      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        In Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula lies Chichen Itza, a vast Mayan city that flourished between the 9th and 13th centuries. It was a major political, economic, 
        and religious center of the Maya civilization, famous for its fusion of Mayan and Toltec cultures. At its heart stands El Castillo (Temple of Kukulcán), a 
        pyramid aligned with astronomical precision. During equinoxes, the play of light and shadow creates the illusion of a serpent descending its staircase, 
        representing the feathered serpent god Kukulcán. The site also features the Great Ball Court, sacred cenotes (sinkholes), and temples decorated with carvings 
        of warriors and deities. Today, Chichen Itza is one of Mexico’s most visited archaeological sites, showcasing the mathematical, architectural, and spiritual 
        sophistication of the Maya.

      <p>
        The entire temple features 365 steps, one for each day of the year. During the spring and summer equinoxes, the afternoon 
        sun casts triangular shadows down the pyramid’s north stairway that resemble a feathered serpent slithering down its surface, heading towards a stone snake 
        head at the base. Historical records suggest the city was in its early phases of development around 600–750 A.D. The growth and development of Chichen Itza 
        span several centuries, with most estimates putting the city at over 1,500 years old. It was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late 
        Classic (AD 600–900) through the Terminal Classic (AD 800–900) and into the Postclassic (AD 900–1200). Through these periods, the city gradually grew in size 
        and diversity. Some colonial Mayan sources and archaeological records suggest that Chichen Itza was sacked during the 13th century and later conquered by the 
        Spanish in the mid-16th century.

        The ancient Mayan city of Chichen Itza, located in present-day Mexico, is a captivating site that holds the remnants of an intriguing civilization. Among its many 
        architectural marvels, the Great Ball Court stands out as an awe-inspiring testament to the athletic prowess and cultural significance of the ancient Mayans. 

        The Great Ball Court at Chichen Itza reveals the profound cultural heritage of the Mayan civilization. This massive playing field served as a venue for the ancient 
        Mesoamerican ballgame, a ritualistic sport with deep spiritual and symbolic undertones. 

        Chichen Itza was once a prominent Mayan city and a center of political, economic, and religious activities. Its strategic location in the Yucatán Peninsula made it a hub 
        for trade and cultural exchange. The city's architectural marvels, such as the Great Ball Court, showcase the advanced engineering skills and astronomical knowledge of the Mayans.

        The Great Ball Court was primarily built to host the Mesoamerican ballgame, involving two teams attempting to pass a rubber ball through stone hoops using only their hips. 
        This physically demanding sport held immense ritualistic importance, often tied to cosmic events and religious ceremonies.

        The ballgame represented the eternal struggle between light and darkness, life and death, and cosmic battles between deities. The Great Ball Court served as a sacred 
        space where these rituals reinforced the spiritual connection between the Mayans and their gods.

        One of the most remarkable features of the court is the Temple of the Jaguars, adorned with carvings of warriors and jaguars. Another striking element is the whispering 
        gallery, where even soft sounds can be heard clearly across the length of the court.

        Over the years, restoration efforts have preserved the Great Ball Court and its surrounding structures, allowing visitors to witness the magnificence of the site and 
        gain insights into the rich Mayan history and culture.

        <h2>Significant inventions and discoveries of the Maya Civilization</h2>
        
        
        <h2>Astronomy</h2>
        We all know about the leap year, and we celebrate it every 4 years - so did Mayans. It is believed that the Mayan calendar is more accurate 
        than the Gregorian calendar, which uses 365.25 days in a year. They worked out that the length of a lunar month should be 29.5308 days, and so 81 lunar 
        months equal to 2,392 days. More, they discovered the 584-day cycle of Venus, and they studied Jupiter, Mars, and Mercury, obtaining celestial information 
        like obscuration, or the path of one planet in front of the other. All this work has left insights to astronomers and how they understand space.
        

        <h2>Mayan Calendar</h2>
        The Mayan calendar may have ended in 2012, their work of the Haab was the sun-based calendar (using 365 days a year) standardized modern 
        calendar.
        

        <h2>Sports</h2>
        Mayans love their sports. That's why an expansive ball court is an important element where both players and spectators can enjoy the 
        games, like pok-a-tok or hotchpotch. The ball court is built at the foot of sanctuaries to pay tribute and respect to the deities.


        <h2>Chocolate</h2>
        Yes! The Mayans were the first to discover how to use cacao beans between 250 and 900 AD. It's hard to imagine how lives are like now had the Mayans not 
        knowing how to mix cacao bean with pepper and cornmeal, which led to the use of Cacao and everything that led to the making of Chocolates.In ancient times, 
        cacao beans were valuable enough to be used as a currency, it's literally edible gold
        

        <h2>Medicine</h2> 
        Well.... the Mayans used hallucination drugs, not exactly the ecstasies that are found in today's rave parties. Instead, the shamans in ancient times discovered 
        stimulating drugs that have the effect to relieve pain and increase energy. A number of these substances were adopted to make painkillers in modern medicine.
        

        <h2>Mathematics</h2> 
        The Mayans introduced "0". More, they have a rather accurate and sophisticated numeric system. One is that the number 0 is still used among us today.
        

        <h2>Art</h2> 
        Mayan art is not exactly an invention (art has been since ancient times) but it was unique in its own way and is widely applauded by people around the world. its 
        pattern, visual, and color are also adopted and applied in today's modern art, which could be found on many decorations and walls. A wide range of materials is used, 
        from wood, jade, obsidian, and so on.
        

        <h2>Writing System</h2>
        The Glyphs is the most advanced form of writing and the Mayans used around 700 different glyphs, and astonishingly 80 percent of the language is still understood today. 
        The Maya script is accepted to be the most comprehensive writing system in Mesoamerica, and the majority of Mayan history was recorded in this system.
        

        <h2>Rubber</h2> 
        Yes, plastic was invented by Charles Goodyear, officially, by mixing chemicals to form polymers, and so on. Interestingly, it is believed that the Mayan produced elastic 
        from latex and mixed it with other plant substances to make elastic items with various properties, including bouncy balls for their ball games.
