      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Carved into rose-red cliffs in southern Jordan, Petra is one of the most remarkable archaeological cities in the world. 
        Once the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom, it thrived around the 4th century BCE by controlling trade routes for incense, 
        spices, and silk between Arabia, Egypt, and the Mediterranean.

        Petra is a huge city that covers an area of 264 square kilometres, roughly 50,000 footballs fields. Usually, you only see the 
        photo of the Treasury which is at least a 30-minute walk to get to itself . However, there is so much more to Petra than just 
        the (Al khaznah) Treasury. Now, tourists are not covering all (264 km2 (102 sq mi))of those – but you will be doing a significant 
        amount of walking before you get to the main attractions! The farthest attractions in Petra are Little Petra and the Tomb of 
        Prophet Aaron. Little Petra is 10 km from the visitors’ centre, while Aaron’s Tomb is 5 km away.

        The story of Petra begins with a group of Arabian nomads called the Nabataeans (pronounced "Nab-a-tee-ans"). As nomads, they moved 
        from place to place, living off the land and herding camels, sheep, and goats. At the height of the Nabataean empire, it included 
        regions of modern-day Jordan, Israel, Egypt, Syria, and northwestern Saudi Arabia.Over time, their sharp survival skills and knowledge 
        of the desert helped the  Nabataeans  become successful traders. They gained control of the important trade routes that moved spices and 
        incense from Arabia to Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. We know that these nomadic merchants became very rich as desert traders, and slowly 
        gave up their goatskin tents to build the grand houses and monuments that became Petra. But it is a mystery why these people gave up their 
        nomadic life to settle down in one place.

      <h3>Obelisks Tomb</h3>
      A beautiful monument and perfect example of the artistic intermarriage of styles between east and west. It is located to the left of the road, the Tomb of Obelisks is one of the more unique buildings in Petra. Dating back to the first century BC, the tomb features one chamber containing five graves and four columns extending from the tomb, each measuring 7 meters in height. In addition, there exists a statue among the obelisks of an older man who is thought to be the owner of the Tomb of Obelisks. The ground floor represents a funeral hall that was used for holding celebrations.
      
      <h3>The Urn Tomb (Court)</h3>
      After passing the Theater, on the other side, there is a set of interfaces, the first one of these interfaces is the Urn Tomb. It measures 16.49 meters and 26 meters in height and comprises two floors supported by arcs. The graves were located at the back end of the tomb but later, as evidence in the Greek inscriptions in the Urn Tomb, in 447 AD were converted into a church with new side doors were added.
      The greatest peculiarity of this monument is the large colonnaded courtyard in front of it, from which you one can enjoy a spectacular view over the entire city. Only the northern (left) colonnade has escaped the wind erosion due to its protected location. It has five columns (height 4.6 m) with a pilaster at either end. The front two columns were built, while the other three were carved from the rock. They seem to support a carved architrave. Above them, there are four loculi and a shallow niche.
      
      <h3>The Theater</h3>
      As you enter heart of the city, the Nabataean theater is located on the left. It was built in the first century AD in the form an arc that is 95 meters in radius and 2.23 meters in height. It is carved in the rock with the exception of the front part, which was already sculpted by the Nabataens. The Theater consists of 45 rows of seats.
      The theater was built in the early 1st century AD and was expanded after the Roman annexation of the Nabataean Kingdom in 106 A.D., slicing trough some older tomb facades. Its auditorium could seat up to 8.000 spectators.
      
      <h3>Baptist Street</h3>
      At the beginning of the street, one can see the remains of the virgin’s fountain. The street was rebuilt in 106 BC with a width of 6 meters. The excavation fossil indicates that there was an older road with 1-2 floor building, lying on its side. On the left of the portico street to the south, there is a set of stairs that leads to the courtyard, which is called the market.
      This is believed to have been the heart of the city and center of various types of commercial activities and transactions during the third century BC. The street continued to be used throughout the Byzantine period during the fourth and fifth centuries, until the sixth. At the end of the road lies the triple gate, which leads to the Girl’s Place.
